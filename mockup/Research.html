            RESEARCH: USER EXPERIENCE DESIGN RESEARCH ON RIDESHARE ECONOMY IN A SMALL-TO-MID TOWN​
        </h2>
        <p>Design can solve many problems and influence our day-to-day activities. ​
            Consequently, I propose to research a personal and problematic day-to-day activity that I experience: ridesharing. In a small-to-medium town like Bloomington/Normal ridesharing is crucial for students and international campus community, as well as for residents who are having car problems or do not feel like driving for many reasons like having an emergency, needing to drive family members while they are at work, or for traveling to and from the airport. ​</p>
      

        
        <p>Even as car owners, we are not always self-sufficient, and we need help from time to time. Apart from the riders, the other part of the rideshare equation are drivers: the ordinary person, the student looking to make extra money, the housewife, the retired store owner, the veteran. Those who drive for financial reasons or to socialize, to overcome being alone and boredom. They also face many challenges daily.​ This research focuses on using the information gathered during as a tool for information design, user experience design research.</p>
