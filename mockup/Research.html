          USER EXPERIENCE DESIGN RESEARCH ON RIDESHARE ECONOMY IN A SMALL-TO-MID TOWN
        </h2>

        <p>Using Bloomington-Normal as a case study, this paper intends to analyse the User Experience Design of the Ridesharing Economy in small-to-mid towns with a particular emphasis on the difficulties that locals encounter when utilising the industry's current platforms. This research specifically intends to solve the issue of driver exploitation by recommending a new ridesharing platform that provides drivers with fair remuneration. A mixed-methods approach is used for the study, combining in-depth interviews with citizens of small towns, local motorists, and business owners, as well as a poll of Bloomington Normal inhabitants. The study is anticipated to offer insights into the creation of a more open, egalitarian, and fair ridesharing experience for both riders and drivers, thereby assisting inhabitants of small towns by giving them access to a dependable and economical transportation option while growing the local economy.  â€‹</p>

        <h3>Introduction</h3>
      
        <p>
          The rise of the sharing economy has given birth to the rideshare industry, which has disrupted the traditional taxi industry. While the rideshare economy has been a boon for urban areas, residents in small-to-mid towns have faced challenges in accessing and using these services. Bloomington-Normal is one such town, where residents have reported difficulties in accessing rideshare services due to long wait times, few service providers, and the inconvenience of the bus routes. <br>

          Residents of Bloomington-Normal face daily challenges when trying to catch up with appointments or find alternative means of transportation due to the unique characteristics of living in a small to mid-sized town. Two instances that illustrate this are as follows: Firstly, when trying to get to the Bloomington Airport, I had to wait for an hour due to the bus schedule, despite it being a 15-minute drive from my location, making access to rideshare applications a useful option. Secondly, when attempting to get to Illinois State University campus from Airport Road at 1 pm, I was unable to drive, walk, or run to my destination as it was a 15-minute drive away and my location was not on the town bus route. Therefore, I utilised both the rideshare platforms Lyf and Uber, but faced multiple rider cancellations, leading to a wait of four hours before finally being picked up. Hence, this research aims to investigate ways of making rideshare services more transparent, equitable, and fair for both riders and drivers in small-to-mid towns like Bloomington-Normal.

        <p>
          The purpose of this research is to examine the User Experience Design of the Rideshare Economy in a small-to-mid town. I am concentrating on the difficulties that residents of small towns encounter when using the rideshare platforms that are available, as well as the difficulties that people who choose to use their vehicles to provide rideshare options for residents, face. The drivers that make their vehicles available on the current platforms (Uber & Lyf) are not appropriately compensated for their service, which has led to a lack of drivers and stranded inhabitants, is one of the main problems that small town residents have noted. This study suggests creating a new ride-sharing platform where drivers receive 80% of the service provider's earnings as a solution to this problem. With this new development, it is anticipated that more drivers will join the platform, increasing the number of vehicles available and boosting Bloomington-Normal's economy. This study also involves distributing surveys to Bloomington-Normal locals. These people include senior citizens and retired people who drive to avoid boredom and meet new people, as well as international students who cannot afford to buy a car and those who can but must wait a while to get a driver's licence. Townies are people who were born and raised in Bloomington-Normal.<br>
        </p>
        <h3>Expected Results</h3>
        <p>1.	The study will identify the key challenges faced by Bloomington-Normal residents in accessing and using rideshare platforms.</p>
        <p>2.	The study will provide insights into the user experience of the rideshare mobile application interface.</p>
        <p>3.	The study will reveal the importance of aesthetics in the rideshare user and service provider experience.</p>
        <p>4.	The study will examine the impact of driver compensation on the number of people who subscribe to rideshare platforms in Bloomington-Normal.</p>
