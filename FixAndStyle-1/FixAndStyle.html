  <p class="redtext"> I'm nobody's taxi service; I'm not gonna be there to catch you every time you feel like jumping out of a spaceship. The way I see it, every life is a pile of good things and bad things...hey...the good things don't always soften the bad things; but vice-versa the bad things don't necessarily spoil the good things and make them unimportant. It's art! A statement on modern society, 'Oh Ain't Modern Society Awful?'! Heh-haa! Super squeaky bum time! You hate me; you want to kill me! Well, go on! Kill me! KILL ME!</p>

  <p>You've swallowed a planet! Annihilate? No. No violence. I won't stand for it. Not now, not ever, do you understand me?! <span class="spanstyle2"> <b>I'm the Doctor</b></span>, the Oncoming Storm - and you basically meant beat them in a football match, didn't you?
